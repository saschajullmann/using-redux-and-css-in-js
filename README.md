#How to use Redux and Emotion in a Gatsby project

This repo demonstrates how to use redux as well as emotion in a gatsby project.
For some background information and a walk through of the example please visit 
[this](https://gatsbythemes.com/blog/how-to-use-redux-and-emotion-in-gatsby) blog post. 

If you want to play with the example, just clone the repo and fine tune it to
your taste. With "yarn dev" you can start the development mode of gatsby and
with "yarn build" you can build the website.
